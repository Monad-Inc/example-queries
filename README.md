# example-queries
A collection of queries and useful info for how to get started querying your monad data

This is a live repo which we expect to continue to evolve as we add more queries, examples and capabilities.

We also welcome community contributions!  If there are queries you have found useful and would like to contribute,
we would love to add them here (with due credit as well!)
